# Drowsiness-Detector-Facial-Sleepiness-Detection
A Python project that uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect drowsiness in real time through the webcam. The system analyzes facial landmarks (eyes, mouth, and head position) to identify signs of fatigue — such as closed eyes or yawning — and triggers a visual or sound alert when it detects that the user may be falling asleep.
